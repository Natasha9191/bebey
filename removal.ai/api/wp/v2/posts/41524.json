They will be the basis of your customer&#8217;s initial judgment. This is crucial since those images will either entice your customers to buy or not.<\/p>\n<p>Customers depend heavily on product images to help them decide what to purchase. They would scrutinize any images of the product and try to visualize them as if they were holding the real thing. And if you are able to satisfy their requirements, you will be able to make a sale in an instant.<\/p>\n<p>Now that we understand the importance of high-quality product images, we must have the necessary tools to be able to do this. The good thing is that all the tools you need are readily available and easy to use.<\/p>\n<p>Removal.Ai is a powerful tool that helps you separate the foreground from the background. When you upload an image, it uses A.I that uses advanced computer vision algorithms to detect foreground pixels. It then instantly removes the background and leaves you with the foreground image. This background remover will allow you to change or edit your images.<\/p>\n<h2>The Power of Visuals in E-commerce<\/h2>\n<figure id=\"attachment_41549\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-41549\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-41549 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image4-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image4-1.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image4-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image4-1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image4-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image4-1-500x263.jpg 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image4-1-600x315.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-41549\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Taras Shypka | <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/person-holding-black-ipad-iFSvn82XfGo\">Unsplash<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Humans are visual beings.

Dealing with cluttered backgrounds.<\/h3>\n<figure id=\"attachment_41556\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-41556\" style=\"width: 1200px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-41556 size-full\" src=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image5-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1200\" height=\"630\" srcset=\"https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image5-1.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image5-1-300x158.jpg 300w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image5-1-1024x538.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image5-1-768x403.jpg 768w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image5-1-500x263.jpg 500w, https:\/\/removal.ai\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/11\/image5-1-600x315.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px\" \/><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-41556\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Kara Eads | <a href=\"https:\/\/unsplash.com\/photos\/green-leafed-plant-lot-on-brown-wooden-table--0eTYFd2pzM\">Unsplash<\/a><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>Too many elements in your photos might be too distracting for your customers. Remember, your product should be the main subject. You aim for potential customers to zero in on the product itself. You have a very limited amount of time to catch their attention when they are browsing and scrolling through the different sites.<\/p>\n<p>A plain and solid-colored background is best for product photography. The product is the main focus of the image and there are no distractions.<br \/>\nBut if you do not like your background to be too bleak, there are other options. Use simple textures like marble patterns, gradation and checkerboards. As long as it is not too cluttered and doesn\u2019t take the attention away from the product itself.<\/p>\n<p>You can use background remover software to make it easier to change and edit.<\/p>\n<h3>b.

There should be consistency with regard to camera angles, background, aperture, lighting, shadows and highlights. The way you edit your saturations, sharpening and crop factor should be the same. Even the size and format of the images needs to be considered. If it could be possible use the same photographer, camera gear and studio setup.<\/p>\n<p>You need this consistency to reinforce your brand. There should be uniformity when your images appear alongside each other. Your customers will find it easier to compare your product. This creates an overall look that would be part of your brand identity. It also helps to make your brand appear more professional and legitimate.<\/p>\n<h3>c.
